<h2>CHORDS<br>Cloud-Hosted Realtime<br>Data Services<br>for the Geosciences</h2>

</form>
<p>
  CHORDS is one of the projects supported by the National Science Foundation 
  <a href="http://earthcube.org">EarthCube</a> initiative, which is
  a community-led cyberinfrastructure initiative for the geosciences.
</p>
<p>
	You are looking at a CHORDS Portal. This is a web service that allows scientists 
	to <strong>easily</strong> provide Internet access to real-time streaming data. 
	Typically these data are measurements made by diverse instruments, which are
	deployed in support of a particular research effort.
</p>
<p>
	Each research team can operate their own portal, which is created simply by running
	a copy of the CHORDS appliance on Amazon cloud services. This provides a web server and
	database. CHORDS can both ingest and deliver data via simple http: requests, just 
	like any web browser. Configuration and management of your private CHORDS
	server is also done through a web interface. Any user on the Internet can attach 
	to the data streams using tools of their choice, such as Matlab, Excel, Python,
	web browsers; i.e. anything that is able to issue an http: request.
</p>
<p>
	CHORDS portals can also forward real-time data streams to higher level
	CHORDS services, which might provide functions such as OGC compliant 
	formatting, mapping services, federation, and just about anything else
	you can think of.
</p>
<p>
	The goals of CHORDS are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To lower the barrier for disemminating real-time geoscience observations via the Internet.</li>
	<li>To provide a simple, "shrink-wrapped" and inexpensive service that will be especially attractive to teams 
		that do not have IT expertise and budgets.</li>
	<li>To provide standards-based interoperability with next level processing systems.</li>
</ul>
